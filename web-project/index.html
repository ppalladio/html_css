                    A healthy meal delivered to your door, every single day

                    We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on
                    consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are
                    very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other
                    important activities, which doesn't leave much time for
                    cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health
                    consequences. We want to solve this problem by using an
                    AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their
                    diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm
                    will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we
                    don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other
                    cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from
                    the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will
                    be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can
                    choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every
                    single day of the month.
